Acknowledgements
================
Although SoulsGym works as a standalone package, we made extensive use of CheatEngine(CE) during 
development. The memory_manipulator module is essentially a Python reimplementation of the memory 
modification capabilities of CheatEngine. In particular we'd like to thank *Dark Byte* for his
activity in the CE forum which helped us understand how games and CE work under the hood.

We also want to thank everyone who worked on the official DarkSoulsIII cheat sheet for CE. Without
all the previous work on address discovery and scripts our work would not have succeeded.

We know that the use of CheatEngine is controversial at best in the gaming community. However this
project would have been impossible without it, so we want to give credit where credit is due.

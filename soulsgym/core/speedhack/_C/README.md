# Speedhack build instructions

The speedhack module is not recompiled on installation since it requires Visual Studio. If you do want to rebuild it, please go through the following steps.

1. Install Visual Studio 2022
2. Open the `speedhack.sln` solution from this folder
3. Rebuild the whole solution. The `speedhack.dll` extension is automatically copied to the _C directory in the last step of the build process
